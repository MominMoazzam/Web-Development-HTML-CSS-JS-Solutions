              Airports are the authorized spaces for aircraft takeoff and landing. While some airports are small private and commuter hubs, we generally think of more extensive commercial flight operations when referring to airports.

Along with runways and terminals, airports also include control towers, hangars, taxiways, lounges, food service areas, restaurants, emergency services, security, baggage handling, and more. Because airports are a connection point between cities, countries, and continents, they have unique requirements when it comes to construction and security.

We have worked on 41 airports around the world—constructing new terminals, control towers, parking lots, runway renovations, and more in places like the United Kingdom and Mexico, to name a few. While we bring extensive experience to our projects, we never stop learning or seeking ways to improve. This is a crucial aspect in an industry with high standards of quality and specifications, which go far beyond standards such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.

While terminals and control towers are what most people envision when they think of airports, what is overlooked, yet equally important to their safety, are the runways and taxiways. Even the ground the airplane sits on for boarding and disembarkation is constructed with safety in mind.

Renovations inside an airport can undoubtedly cause a level of inconvenience to passengers, while improvements outside can often have a far greater impact on passengers and airport operations due to flight cancellations and delays.

According to a study by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, domestic flight delays were found to cost the U.S. economy $31.2 billion in 2007, including $8.3 billion in direct costs to airlines, $16.7 billion in direct costs to passengers, $2.2 billion from lost demand and $4.0 billion in forgone GDP.

In 2016 we were involved in the regeneration of 70,000 tons of flexible pavement at the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport. We completed this record-setting job in just five days with crews working 24 hours a day, significantly reducing the negative impact on operations and the economy.
